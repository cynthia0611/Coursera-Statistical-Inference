####Swirl Practice Probability 1
```
| What is the probability of rolling an even number?

1: 1/3
2: 1/2
3: 0
4: 1
```
> Half of the outcomes are even and half are odd. There are three even outcomes (2,4, and 6) and three odd (1,3, and 5)


```
| Suppose you rolled the fair die twice. What is the probability of rolling the same number
| two times in a row?

1: 1/36
2: 2/6
3: 1/6
4: 0

Selection: 1

| Not quite right, but keep trying.

| Since we don't care what the outcome of the first roll is, its probability is 1. The
| second roll of the dice has to match the outcome of the first, so that has a probability
| of 1/6. The probability of both events occurring is 1 * 1/6.

1: 0
2: 2/6
3: 1/6
4: 1/36

Selection: 3
