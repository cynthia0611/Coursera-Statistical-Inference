##### Swirl practice Residuals diagnostic & Variance

Residuals of individual samples are sometimes treated as ```having the same variance```, which is estimated as the sample
variance of the entire set of residuals. Theoretically, however, residuals of individual samples have different
variances and these differences can become large in the presence of outliers. ```Standardized and Studentized``` residuals
attempt to ```compensate``` for this effect in two slightly different ways. Both use ```hat values```.
