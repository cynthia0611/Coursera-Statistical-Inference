#### Swirl Practice Expectations
> Expectations
```
| The expected value of a random variable X, E(X), is a measure of its central tendency. For a discrete
| random variable X with PMF p(x), E(X) is defined as a sum, over all possible values x, of the quantity
| x*p(x). E(X) represents the center of mass of a collection of locations and weights, {x, p(x)}.

| Another term for expected value is mean. Recall your high school definition of arithmetic mean (or
| average) as the sum of a bunch of numbers divided by the number of numbers you added together. This is
| consistent with the formal definition of E(X) if all the numbers are equally weighted.

| One of the nice properties of the expected value operation is that it's linear. This means that, if c
| is a constant, then E(cX) = c*E(X). Also, if X and Y are two random variables then E(X+Y)=E(X)+E(Y).
| It follows that E(aX+bY)=aE(X)+bE(Y).

| For a continuous random variable X, the expected value is defined analogously as it was for the
| discrete case. Instead of summing over discrete values, however, the expectation integrates over a
| continuous function.

| For a discrete
| random variable X with PMF p(x), E(X) is defined as a sum, over all possible values x, of the quantity
| x*p(x).

| It follows that for continuous random variables, E(X) is the area under the function t*f(t), where
| f(t) is the PDF (probability density function) of X. This definition borrows from the definition of
| center of mass of a continuous body.

> apply function
```
| Each of these 10 samples will have a mean, right? We can use the R function apply to calculate the
| mean of each row of the matrix allsam. We simply call apply with the arguments allsam, 1, and mean.
| The second argument, 1, tells 'apply' to apply the third argument 'mean' to the rows of the matrix.
