Consider influenza epidemics for two parent heterosexual families. Suppose that the probability is 17% that at least one of the parents has contracted the disease. The probability that the father has contracted influenza is 12% while the probability that both the mother and father have contracted the disease is 6%. What is the probability that the mother has contracted influenza?

```
p(father or mother) = 17%
p(father) = 12%
p(father and mother) = 6%

p(father or mother) = p(father) + p(mother) - p(father and mother)
17% = 12% + p(mother) - 6%
```
