#### Swirl Practice Expectations
```
| The expected value of a random variable X, E(X), is a measure of its central tendency. For a discrete
| random variable X with PMF p(x), E(X) is defined as a sum, over all possible values x, of the quantity
| x*p(x). E(X) represents the center of mass of a collection of locations and weights, {x, p(x)}.
```

```
| Another term for expected value is mean. Recall your high school definition of arithmetic mean (or
| average) as the sum of a bunch of numbers divided by the number of numbers you added together. This is
| consistent with the formal definition of E(X) if all the numbers are equally weighted.
```

```
| One of the nice properties of the expected value operation is that it's linear. This means that, if c
| is a constant, then E(cX) = c*E(X). Also, if X and Y are two random variables then E(X+Y)=E(X)+E(Y).
| It follows that E(aX+bY)=aE(X)+bE(Y).
