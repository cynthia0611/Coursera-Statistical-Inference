| We want to emphasize a couple of important points here. First, a statistic (singular) is
| a number computed from a sample of data. We use statistics to infer information about a
| population. Second, a random variable is an outcome from an experiment. Deterministic
| processes, such as computing means or variances, applied to random variables, produce
| additional random variables which have their own distributions. It's important to keep
| straight which distributions you're talking about.
