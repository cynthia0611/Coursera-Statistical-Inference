| What is the probability of rolling an even number?

1: 1/3
2: 1/2
3: 0
4: 1
```
> Half of the outcomes are even and half are odd. There are three even outcomes (2,4, and 6) and three odd (1,3, and 5)

| Suppose you rolled the fair die twice. What is the probability of rolling the same number
| two times in a row?

1: 1/36
2: 2/6
3: 1/6
4: 0

Selection: 1

| Not quite right, but keep trying.

| Since we don't care what the outcome of the first roll is, its probability is 1. The
| second roll of the dice has to match the outcome of the first, so that has a probability
| of 1/6. The probability of both events occurring is 1 * 1/6.

1: 0
2: 2/6
3: 1/6
4: 1/36

Selection: 3

| The probability of rolling an even number is 1/2 or 18/36. There are 10 ways of rolling a
| number greater than '8' - 4 ways for rolling '9', 3 for '10', 2 for '11' and 1 for '12'.
| How big is the intersection between rolling an even number and those greater than '8'?

1: (18+10-4)/36
2: (18+10-2)/36
3: (18+4-2)/36
4: (18+10)/36

Selection: 1

| A deck of cards is a set of 52 cards, 4 suits of 13 cards each. There are two red suits,
| diamonds and hearts, and two black suits, spades and clubs. Each of the 13 cards in a
| suit has a value - an ace which is sometimes thought of as 1, a number from 2 to 10, and
| 3 face cards, king, queen, and jack. We've created a deck in R for you. Type 'deck' to
| see it now.

| Suppose you draw a face card and don't replace it in the deck. What is the probability
| that when you draw a second card it also will be a face card of the same suit?
1: 12/51
2: 11/52
3: 0
4: 11/51

Selection: 4

| Suppose you draw a face card and don't replace it in the deck. What is the probability
| that when you draw a second card it also will be a face card of the same suit?
