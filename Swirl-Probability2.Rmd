####Swirl Practice Probability 2
```
| Continuous random variables are usually associated with measurements of time, distance,
| or some biological process since they can take on any value, often within some specified
| range. Limitations of precision in taking the measurements may imply that the values are
| discrete; we in fact consider them continuous.
```

```
| The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable X, either discrete or
| continuous, is the function F(x) equal to the probability that X is less than or equal to
| x. In the example above, the area of the blue triangle represents the probability that
| the random variable was less than or equal to the value 1.6.
```

```
| The survivor function S(x) of a random variable X is defined as the function of x equal
| to the probability that the random variable X is greater than the value x. This is the
| complement of the CDF F(x), in our example, the portion of the lower triangle that is not
| shaded.
