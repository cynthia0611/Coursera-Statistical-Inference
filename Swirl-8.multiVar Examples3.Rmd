##### Swirl practice Multi-Variable Examples 3

Now let's use R's subsetting capability to look at the rates of hunger for the different genders to see how, or even
if, they differ.  Once again use the R function lm to generate the linear model in which the rate of hunger (Numeric)
for female children depends on Year. Put the result in the variable lmF. You'll have to use the R construct
x[hunger$Sex=="Female"] to pick out both the correct Numerics and the correct Years.


> lmF <- lm(Numeric[hunger$Sex="Female"]~Year,hunger)
Error: unexpected '=' in "lmF <- lm(Numeric[hunger$Sex="

> lmF <- lm(Numeric[hunger$Sex=="Female"] ~ Year,hunger)
Error in model.frame.default(formula = Numeric[hunger$Sex == "Female"] ~  : 
  variable lengths differ (found for 'Year')
  
> lmF <- lm(Numeric[hunger$Sex=="Female"] ~ Year[hunger$Sex=="Female"],hunger)
