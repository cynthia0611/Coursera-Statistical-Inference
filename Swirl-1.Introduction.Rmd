####Swirl Practice Introduction
```
| We want to emphasize a couple of important points here. First, a statistic (singular) is
| a number computed from a sample of data. We use statistics to infer information about a
| population. Second, a random variable is an outcome from an experiment. Deterministic
| processes, such as computing means or variances, applied to random variables, produce
| additional random variables which have their own distributions. It's important to keep
| straight which distributions you're talking about.
```

```
| Finally, there are two broad flavors of inference. The first is frequency, which uses
| "long run proportion of times an event occurs in independent, identically distributed
| repetitions." The second is Bayesian in which the probability estimate for a hypothesis
| is updated as additional evidence is acquired. Both flavors require an understanding of
| probability so that's what the next lessons will cover.
