mean 
characterizes the center of a distribution

variance and its square root
the standard deviation, characterize the distribution's spread around the mean.

sample mean estimates the population mean
the sample variance estimates the population variance
 
The variance of a random variable, as a measure of spread or dispersion, is, like a mean, defined as an expected value. It is the expected squared distance of the variable from its mean.
Var(X) = E( (X-mu)^2 ) = E( (X-E(X))^2 ) = E(X^2)-E(X)^2

E(X), the expected value of a random variable from the population, is mu, the mean of that population.
Higher variance implies more spread around a mean than lower variance.

linearity of expectations that, if a is a constant, then Var(aX)=a^2*Var(X).

compute E(X^2)
From the definition of expected values, this means we'll take a weighted sum over all possible values of X^2. The weight is the probability of X occurring.

several normal distributions all centered around a common mean 0, but with different standard deviations.
the thinner the bell the smaller the standard deviation and the bigger the standard deviation the fatter the bell.

population variance sigma^2 and a sample variance s^2

The sample variance is defined as the sum of n squared distances from the sample mean divided by (n-1), where n is the number of samples or observations

sample variance is an unbiased estimator of population variance.

Recall that the average of random samples from a population is itself a random variable with a distribution centered around the population mean. Specifically, E(X') = mu, where X' represents a sample mean and mu is the population mean.

We can show that, if the population is infinite, the variance of the sample mean is the population variance divided by the sample size.

Recall that Var is an expected value and expected values are linear. Also recall that our samples X_1, X_2,...,X_n are independent. What does Var(Sum(X_i)) equal?
Sum(Var(X_i))

Var(X')=Var(1/n*Sum(X_i))=(1/n^2)*Var(Sum(X_i))=(1/n^2)*Sum(sigma^2)=sigma^2/n for infinite populations when our samples are independent.

the variance of a sample mean is sigma^2 / n and we estimate it with s^2 / n
s / sqrt(n), is the standard error of the sample mean.

The R function rnorm(n,mean,sd) generates n independent (hence uncorrelated) random normal samples with the specified mean and standard deviation.
